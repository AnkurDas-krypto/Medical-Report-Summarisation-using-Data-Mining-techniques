Oral contraceptive use and reproductive factors may initiate long- term changes to the hormonal milieu and thereby, possibly influence colorectal cancer risk. We examined the association of hormonal and reproductive factors with risk of colorectal cancer among 337802 women in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition, of whom 1878 developed colorectal cancer. After stratification for center and age, and adjustment for body mass index, smoking, diabetes mellitus, physical activity and alcohol consumption, ever use of oral contraceptives was marginally inversely associated with colorectal cancer risk (hazard ratio (HR), 0.92; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.83- 1.02), although this association was stronger among post- menopausal women (HR, 0.84; 95% CI: 0.74- 0.95). Duration of oral contraceptive use and reproductive factors, including age at menarche, age at menopause, type of menopause, ever having an abortion, parity, age at first full- term pregnancy and breastfeeding, were not associated with colorectal cancer risk. Our findings provide limited support for a potential inverse association between oral contraceptives and colorectal cancer risk. Men tend to have a slightly higher incidence of colorectal cancer than women of similar age (American Cancer Society, 2007). Oestrogen has been implicated for this decreased risk in women through mechanisms that involve reduction of secondary bile  acid production (McMichael and Potter, 1980; Bayerdorffer et al, 1995), reduction of circulating insulin- like growth factor-I (Campagnoli et al, 1993; Renehan et al, 2004), and protection of the oestrogen receptor gene from methylation (Issa et al, 1994). The epidemiologic evidence for a casual link between oral contraceptives  and colorectal cancer risk is equivocal. Some studies have suggested inverse associations (Potter and McMichael, 1983; Martinez et al, 1997; Fernandez et al, 1998; Nichols et al, 2005; Campbell et al, 2007; Hannaford et al, 2007; Lin et al, 2007; Kabat et al, 2008), whereas others have found no association (Weiss et al, 1981; Bostick et al, 1994; Jacobs et al, 1994; Platz et al, 1997; Troisi et al, 1997; Levi et al, 2003; Purdue et al, 2005; Dorjgochoo et al, 2009; Rosenblatt et al, 2009). A recent meta- analysis, summarising the results from 7 cohort and 11 case- control studies, reported a statistically significant 19% reduced risk among ever users of oral contraceptives compared with never users, although there was no clear association with increasing duration of use (Bosetti et al, 2009). No consistent association has been observed for menstrual and reproductive variables and risk of colorectal cancer (Weiss et al, 1981; Potter and McMichael, 1983; Peters et al, 1990; Wu- Williams et al, 1991; Gerhardsson de Verdier and London, 1992; Bostick et al, 1994; Jacobs et al, 1994; Kampman et al, 1997; Martinez et al, 1997;  Platz et al, 1997; Talamini et al, 1998; Nichols et al, 2005; Purdue et al, 2005; Lin et al, 2007; Sakauchi, 2007; Akhter et al, 2008; Kabat et al, 2008; Rosenblatt et al, 2009), although the majority of the studies are case- control or small cohort studies with low power to study dose- response associations. We examined the associations of oral contraceptive use and reproductive variables with colorectal cancer risk in the large European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) cohort. Study participants included 1878 female colorectal cancer cases (1295 colon and 583 rectal cancers) and 335924 female non- cases recruited into EPIC, a prospective cohort that was established in the 1990s in 10 European countries with more than half a million participants, mostly aged 35- 70 years. Incident cancer cases were identified through linkage to population cancer registries in Denmark, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden and the UK, or with a combination of methods incluing linkage to health insurance records, cancer and pathology registries, and active follow- up of study participants or their next of kin in France, Germany and Greece. The colorectal cancer diagnosis was confirmed by histology for 80.2% of the cases, by clinical examination for 11.6% and the remaining 8.2% by self- report, autopsy or death certificate. Women were excluded if they had prevalent cancer at recruitment, if they did not return the baseline lifestyle questionnaire, if they never menstruated or if they had missing information on all exposure variables. Details on the cohort population, the data collection procedures and the outcome and covariate assessment methods have been described in detail elsewhere (Riboli et al, 2002; Tsilidis et al, 2010). Women were asked at the baseline questionnaire whether they had ever used oral contraceptives, their duration of use and age they started use. Information on age at menarche and menopause, numbers of full- term pregnancies (live and still births) and induced or spontaneous abortions, age at the first full- term pregnancy and the reason for menopause (natural vs surgical) was also collected. Information on breast- feeding was collected for the first three full- term pregnancies and the last one. Menopausal status was defined according to information on mentruation status and ovariectomy, details of which are provided elsewhere (Dossus et al, 2010). Hazard ratios (HR) and their 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for colorectal cancer were estimated using Cox proportional hazards models stratified by EPIC- participating center and age at recruitment (<=50, 51- 53, 54- 56, 57- 59, 60- 62, 63- 65, >65 years) and adjusted for smoking status (never, former and current), self- reported diabetes mellitus (no or yes), body mass index (BMI; <25, >= 25- <30, >=30 kg m- 2), physical activity (inactive, moderately inactive, moderately active, active) and alcohol intake (quartiles: <0.58, >= 0.58- <3.61, >=3.61- <11.08, >=11.08 g per day). Missing values for smoking status (2.2%), diabetes (4.2%), physical activity (13.4%) and alcohol (0.8%) were included as a separate category in the models. An analysis that excluded women with missing values for those covariates provided very similar results and these are not presented here. Further adjustment for menopausal hormone therapy, waist and hip circumference, waist to hip ratio, dietary variables (intakes of energy, saturated fat, fibre, folate, calcium and red meat) or mutual adjustment for oral contraceptive use and reproductive factors in relevant models gave virtually identical results. Analyses was also performed according to EPIC country, cancer subsite (colon vs rectum) and potentially modifying factors (age at recruitment (at the median, <51 vs >=51 years), BMI (<25 vs >=25 kg m- 2), menopausal hormone therapy (ever vs never) and menopausal status (post- vs pre-/ peri- menopausal)).
