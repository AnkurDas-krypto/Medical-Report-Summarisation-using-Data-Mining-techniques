Oral contraceptive use and reproductive factors may initiate long- term changes to the hormonal milieu and thereby, possibly influence colorectal cancer risk.
We examined the association of hormonal and reproductive factors with risk of colorectal cancer among 337802 women in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition, of whom 1878 developed colorectal cancer.
After stratification for center and age, and adjustment for body mass index, smoking, diabetes mellitus, physical activity and alcohol consumption, ever use of oral contraceptives was marginally inversely associated with colorectal cancer risk (hazard ratio (HR), 0.92; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.83- 1.02), although this association was stronger among post- menopausal women (HR, 0.84; 95% CI: 0.74- 0.95).
Duration of oral contraceptive use and reproductive factors, including age at menarche, age at menopause, type of menopause, ever having an abortion, parity, age at first full- term pregnancy and breastfeeding, were not associated with colorectal cancer risk.
Our findings provide limited support for a potential inverse association between oral contraceptives and colorectal cancer risk.
Men tend to have a slightly higher incidence of colorectal cancer than women of similar age (American Cancer Society, 2007).
Oestrogen has been implicated for this decreased risk in women through mechanisms that involve reduction of secondary bile  acid production (McMichael and Potter, 1980; Bayerdorffer et al, 1995), reduction of circulating insulin- like growth factor-I (Campagnoli et al, 1993; Renehan et al, 2004), and protection of the oestrogen receptor gene from methylation (Issa et al, 1994).
The epidemiologic evidence for a casual link between oral contraceptives  and colorectal cancer risk is equivocal.
Some studies have suggested inverse associations (Potter and McMichael, 1983; Martinez et al, 1997; Fernandez et al, 1998; Nichols et al, 2005; Campbell et al, 2007; Hannaford et al, 2007; Lin et al, 2007; Kabat et al, 2008), whereas others have found no association (Weiss et al, 1981; Bostick et al, 1994; Jacobs et al, 1994; Platz et al, 1997; Troisi et al, 1997; Levi et al, 2003; Purdue et al, 2005; Dorjgochoo et al, 2009; Rosenblatt et al, 2009).
A recent meta- analysis, summarising the results from 7 cohort and 11 case- control studies, reported a statistically significant 19% reduced risk among ever users of oral contraceptives compared with never users, although there was no clear association with increasing duration of use (Bosetti et al, 2009).
No consistent association has been observed for menstrual and reproductive variables and risk of colorectal cancer (Weiss et al, 1981; Potter and McMichael, 1983; Peters et al, 1990; Wu- Williams et al, 1991; Gerhardsson de Verdier and London, 1992; Bostick et al, 1994; Jacobs et al, 1994; Kampman et al, 1997; Martinez et al, 1997;  Platz et al, 1997; Talamini et al, 1998; Nichols et al, 2005; Purdue et al, 2005; Lin et al, 2007; Sakauchi, 2007; Akhter et al, 2008; Kabat et al, 2008; Rosenblatt et al, 2009), although the majority of the studies are case- control or small cohort studies with low power to study dose- response associations.
